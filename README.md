Contains used R code to study the research question: "Cryptocurrency Market, A Bubble? - A Unit Root Approach"  

Abstract (out of my thesis): 
> "The behaviour of the cryptocurrency market has often been characterized as a bubble in a vast number of publications. Due to the lack of the fundamental value, or rather the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies, one can only apply several econometric methods to test for a bubble-like behaviour with accordance to the price development. This paper makes use of a recently developed econometric bubble method that relies on a unit root approach. Furthermore, the growing number of studies on whether a contagion effect by a specific cryptocurrency lays in another coin, is taken as a motivation in this study for the use of a bivariate Granger causality test. An empirical application uses six cryptocurrency coins in which a general evidence of a bubble is confirmed. It further concludes possible patterns to give a clue of such contagion effects. The findings of this paper could motivate further studies of testing bubbles in the cryptocurrency market with an augmentation of contagion market effects."
